The goal of `easylift` is to perform genomic liftover given `GRanges` and `chain` file.

## Installation instructions

<!-- Get the latest stable `R` release from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `easylift` from [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) using the following code: -->

<!-- ```{r 'install', eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) { -->
<!--     install.packages("BiocManager") -->
<!-- } -->

<!-- BiocManager::install("easylift") -->
<!-- ``` -->

Get the latest development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/nahid18/easylift) with:

```{r 'install_dev', eval = FALSE}
BiocManager::install("nahid18/easylift")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r library, eval = requireNamespace('easylift', 'GenomicRanges')}
library("easylift")
library("GenomicRanges")
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
gr <- GRanges(seqname = Rle(paste("chr", 1, sep = "")),
              ranges = IRanges(start = 1, end = 200000))
genome(gr) <- "hg19"
to <- "hg38"
chain <- "hg19ToHg38.over.chain.gz"
lifted <- easylift(gr, to, chain)
```

## Citation

Below is the citation output from using `citation('easylift')` in R. Please
run this yourself to check for any updates on how to cite __easylift__.

```{r 'citation', eval = requireNamespace('easylift')}
print(citation('easylift'), bibtex = TRUE)
```

Please note that the `easylift` was only made possible thanks to many other R and bioinformatics software authors, which are cited either in the vignettes and/or the paper(s) describing this package.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that the `easylift` project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](http://bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct/). By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

## Development tools

* Continuous code testing is possible thanks to [GitHub actions](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/usethis-1-6-0/)  through `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('usethis')`, `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('remotes')`, and `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('rcmdcheck')` customized to use [Bioconductor's docker containers](https://www.bioconductor.org/help/docker/) and `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('BiocCheck')`.
* Code coverage assessment is possible thanks to [codecov](https://codecov.io/gh) and `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('covr')`.
* The [documentation website](http://nahid18.github.io/easylift) is automatically updated thanks to `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('pkgdown')`.
* The code is styled automatically thanks to `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('styler')`.
* The documentation is formatted thanks to `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('devtools')` and `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('roxygen2')`.

For more details, check the `dev` directory.

This package was developed using `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('biocthis')`.
