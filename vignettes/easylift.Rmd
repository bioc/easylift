# Getting Started

## Installation

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
BiocManager::install("nahid18/easylift")
```

## Import

```{r setup}
library("easylift")
library("GenomicRanges")
```

## Arguments

Create a `GRanges` object, assign a genome to it, and specify chain file

```{r example}
gr <- GRanges(seqname = Rle(paste("chr", 1, sep = "")),
              ranges = IRanges(start = 1, end = 200000))
genome(gr) <- "hg19"
to <- "hg38"

# you should next just point directly to a file on your machine.
# here, we use the `system.file()` function because this is a vignette
chain <- system.file("extdata/hg19ToHg38.over.chain.gz", package="easylift")

gr
```

## Run

```{r run}
easylift(gr, to, chain)
```

## Cache (optional)

If you have the chain file in cache with `BiocFileCache` package, you don't have to specify `chain` argument

```{r bioCache, eval=FALSE}
gr |> easylift("hg38")
```
