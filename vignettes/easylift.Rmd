# Getting Started

## Installation

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
BiocManager::install("easylift")
```

## Import

```{r setup}
library("easylift")
```

## Arguments

Create a `GRanges` object, assign a genome to it, and specify chain file

```{r example}
gr <- GRanges(
  seqname = Rle(
    c("chr1", "chr2"), 
    c(100000, 100000)
  ),
  ranges = IRanges(
    start = 1, end = 200000
  )
)
genome(gr) <- "hg19"
to <- "hg38"
# Here, we use the `system.file()` function because the chain file is in the
# package (however if you need to point to any other file on your machine,
# just do 'chain <- "path/to/your/hg19ToHg38.over.chain.gz"'):
chain <- system.file("extdata", "hg19ToHg38.over.chain.gz", package = "easylift")

gr
```

## Run

```{r run}
easylift(gr, to, chain)
```

## BiocFileCache

To use `BiocFileCache` for the chain file, you can add it to the cache
as follows:

```{r bioCache, eval=FALSE}
chain_file <- "/path/to/your/hg19ToHg38.over.chain.gz"
bfc <- BiocFileCache()
bfcadd(bfc, chain_file)
```

Then, you can use it in `easylift` like this:

```{r bioCache2, eval=FALSE}
gr |> easylift("hg38")
```
